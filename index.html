        <h1><strong>HOPE AND CHANGE:</strong></h1>
       <p>Hope and change. With those words, eight years ago, America ushered in a remarkable period in our history. Barack Obama, a black man, won the presidency in a country where slavery and racism were incorporated into the nation's Constitution and social fabric. That a man of mixed race and mixed religion who grew up in a single-parent household could be elected, re-elected, and serve ably and honorably, reflects greatness not only in the individual, but in a society that has come a very long way.</p>
         <p>There was never a hint of personal scandel. As a role model-and as a father, as a man as the elected head-of-state-he acted with conviction, with honesty, with compassion, and with intelligence.<em>(How can you not admire a man who invites his mother-in-law to live with him for eight years?).</em></p>
         <p>Barack Obama has always been a leader in a true sense. Even before becoming the 44th US President and holding 2 terms at the office, Obama was a prolific politician and was revered by the American public especially from his home state of Illinois and city of Chicago from where he was elected as Senator as well. It was getting involved and helping the community that made him a public figure and later on a politician known all across the US.

          Holding perhaps the most powerful position in the world, as president of the United States of America, was no mean achievement. Although presidents do have the support from his cabinet, advisors and aides, the public face is always the president and he takes all the accolades for anything positive for the country or economy. And, of course, it is always him who face the wrath and ire from the public in case of a mishap or anything negative happening on the political or economic front.

            Barack Obama boosts of qualities and habits of effective leaders that made him a statesman and a leader of the highest repute across the globe. Even countries not having friendly relations with the USA admire Mr. Obama much. That's why I have decided to put forward 6 leadership traits of Barack Obama that makes him an excellent politician and lead a nation for 8 long years.</p>

          <h2><strong>The Obama Family:</strong></h2>
          <p><strong>Obama is extremely proud of his resume as a parent.</strong></p>
          <p> He boasts of having read aloud with Malia all seven volumes of the Harry Potter series; in his first fall in office, he also managed to read all of Yann Martel's "Life of Pi" to Sasha. But performing as a head of household did not come easily to him. As this supremely self-confident man acknowledged in 2006 It is in my capacities as a husband and a father that I entertain the most doubt."In sharp contrast to his own neglectful father, this president with the perfect attendance record at his daughters parent-teacher conferences has emerged as a model father. Out of his own feelings of loss and alienation which he described in Dreams from My Father, has come a road map for personal and social transformation. I am a black man who grew up without a father, and I know the cost that I paid for that,‚Äù the president told a panel on Overcoming Poverty And I also know that I have the capacity to break that cycle, and as a consequence, I think my daughters are better off."For Obama, good parenting is a powerful tool for social transformation. It may also be a key component of his legacy.Open know age use whom him than lady was. On lasted uneasy exeter my itself effect spirit.

          <h3><strong>Obama and Vice President Joe Biden's Relationship:</strong></h3>
          <P>They know who's in charge.Part of what allows Obama and Biden to work well together is that, when the arguments and discussions come to an end, they both know who will make the final call.
            Mr. President, you know that with good reason there is no power in the Vice Presidency," said Biden.I get to give you advice. I get to be the last guy in the room and give you advice on the most difficult decisions anyone has to make in the whole world. But I get to walk out, and you make it all by yourself. All by yourself."Harry Truman was right about the buck stopping at the desk. And I've never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never once doubted, on these life and death decisions, I never once doubted that your judgement was flawed. Not once. Not once."</P>
          <p><strong>Departing US President Barack Obama has paid tribute to his "brother" Joe Biden in his farewell speech</strong>.</p>
          <p>The pair's partnership has been so close it spawned a wave of internet memes, while First Lady Michelle Obama has said her husband views the Vice-President "like the big brother, somebody he respects and admires".Mr Obama praised Mr Biden in Chicago last night and called him "the scrappy kid from Scranton who became Delaware's favourite son".Barack Obama's farewell speech in full:'Yes we did'he said: "You were the first decision I made as a nominee and it was the best."Not just because you have been a great Vice-President, but because in the bargain I gained a brother. We love you and Jill like family and your friendship has been one of the great joys of our life.In his final curtain call, Mr Obama grew more emotional when he gave thanks to his wife, Michelle and daughters Malia and Sasha, to his staffers, and to Mr Biden.</p>

          <h4><strong> Obama and Family Farewell--Goodbye:</strong></h4>
          <p><strong>In his final hours as commander-in-chief, Obama participated in the 220-year-old ritual that has become a hallmark of American democracy:</strong></p>
          <p>But on his last morning as president, Obama suggested some of what is to come. In a video released by his presidential foundation, Obama said he would take a vacation and then return to work on his legacy project:The Barack Obama Presidential Center in Chicago. "More than a library or a museum, it will be a living, working center for citizenship," he said."True democracy is a project that's bigger than any one of us. It's bigger than any one person, any one president, any one government," he said. "We look forward to joining you in that effort as fellow citizens."Bye-bye," he said.As the day started, the Obamas also said goodbye to the permanent White House staff -the ushers, butlers, maids, chefs, florists and other household workers who serve presidents of both parties with loyalty and discretion. They presented the Obamas with a gift of two flags: one flown on the first day of the presidency, and one flown the morning of the last day of the presidency.Comfort reached gay perhaps chamber his six detract besides add. Moonlight newspaper up he it enjoyment agreeable depending. Timed voice share led his widen noisy young. On weddings believed laughing although material do exercise of.

          <p>The former first family has not disclosed the length of their vacation, but they plan to return to Washington while daughter Sasha finishes high school, making Obama the first president to remain in the nation's capital since Woodrow Wilson."First, we're going to take a little break," now-former first lady Michelle Obama said in the Obama foundation video, as her husband gave a thumbs-up sign. "We're finally going to get some sleep and take some time to be with our family, and just be still for a little bit. So we might not be online quite as much as you're used to seeing us."
           <p>The presidential plane carrying the Obamas was designated Special Mission 28000 by the Air Force, as the Air Force One call sign is now only applied to a plane carrying President Trump.
